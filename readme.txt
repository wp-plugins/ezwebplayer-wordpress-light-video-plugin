**Using the EZWebPlayer WordPress Lite Plugin**
After you have installed the EZWebPlayer WordPress Lite Plugin all you have to do now is follow these easy instructions and you should have video in your WordPress blog in no time. First we will cover the player's;
- Default Options
- Placing a video in a blog post
- Viewing a list of the blog posts that house your videos

**Default Options**
You have the option of setting up default player characteristics that each player will take on during the adding of a video to a blog post. For example if you are going to post 10 videos that use a wide(16:9) aspect ratio, use a Red color scheme and is 400 x 242 then you won't want to select these options over and over again for each of the 10 videos. That would take up way too much time. This is where the default options come into play.

**Step 1** Login to your WordPress blog's admin console and select the Settings option in the left navigation and then select the EZWebPlayer Lite option to open your EZWebPlayer Lite's default settings.

**Step 2** Using the Default Options you can pre-select the default settings every future player will have. Of course you can edit the default options at any time as well as the settings a player will use during the adding of a video to your blog, but setting these options now will save you time in the future so you don't have to select these settings for every player down the road. Once you have your selections made, make sure to select the “Save Changes” button to save your work.

When selecting a Color Scheme, this will alter the colors the players control bar uses. We give you the option of 12 different color schemes to help custom fit the player into most WordPress blogs seamlessly. Those 12 color schemes are
- Beige
- Dark Grey
- Grey
- Navy Blue
- Night
- Olive
- Pink
- Red
- Sky Blue
- Standard Skin
- Taupe
- White

You also have the option of selecting the aspect ratio of your video. (4:3) represents a regular aspect ratio. An example of a 4:3 aspect ratio or video dimension could be a regular square TV or a computer screen that is not wide screen. The aspect ratio 16:9 represents the wide aspect ratio or more commonly known as wide screen. Wide screen can be seen on most new wide TVs. Things to note

-A 4:3 video in a 16:9 player will place black bars on the top and bottom of the video.
-A 16:9 video in a 4:3 player will place black bars on the left and right of the video.
-(http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/) is a great site to calculate a video's perfect aspect ratio

The player size drop down box will show you pre-calculated sizes that work great with 4:3 and 16:9 video and the players control bar. You should notice that when you select an aspect ratio the size options will switch from 4:3 size to 16:9 sizes and vice versa.

When selecting to use a Play Arrow, this will show a play arrow over the video when the video is in its paused state.

**Placing a video in a blog post**
When you are editing your blog posts, if you want to add a video into the post using the EZWebPlayer WordPress Lite Plugin, all you have to do is select the light blue play icon located above the edit window. This will open the EZWebPlayer WordPress Lite Plugin's “Add EZWebPlayer Lite Videos” window.?
When the “Add EZWebPlayer Lite Videos” window is open, you have to enter the URL to your video. You also have the option of placing in a thumbnail of the video that will show up before the video is played. You can also select to use the default settings you should have already set up or you can use new settings for this video. You are given the option of selecting the videos

- Color Scheme
- Player Ratio
- Player Size
- To use/not use a play arrow over the video during its paused state

Once you have selected your video options you can then post the video to your blog by pressing the Post Video button in this windows lower right corner.

After your video is posted you will notice a bit of code is placed into your blog post. This code represents the video you just created.?
